# Danny-Ma-s-8-week-SQL-Challenge-Case-study-2---Pizza-Runner

The Pizzer Runner is a popular food delivery service that is known for delivering delicious pizzas to their customers. Pizzer Runner has a database of customer orders which contains various types of data.

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
